# Fillit
42 School project. From the subject (also available in french):

> Fillit is not about recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. Your program will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible.
>
> Obviously, your main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
>
> You should think carefully about how you will structure your data and how to solve this problem, if you want your program answers before the next millenium.
